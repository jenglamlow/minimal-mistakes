When I was googling sample code for my Python project with the keyword "python try catch". 
Suddenly, the google search page is distorted and there is an invitation from Google to participate the Foobar Challenge. Refer to image on top

I've read about Google Foobar previously, where 
[Google was reported of using this approach to hire the top talent](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/google-foobar-how-searching-web-earned-software-graduate-job-google-1517284).
I was excited when I receive this invitation, clicking the button "I want to play" bring me to [Foobar](https://www.google.com/foobar/) page, 
which is a command terminal page.

Typing "requests" will get a puzzle from foobar and you will need to solve it within certain timeframe. 
After solving one challenges, you can continue to request another challenge or choose to stop. Foobar will store your progress bar tied to your Google username,
so the next time you login, it will continue the stage you stopped.

There are a total of 5 levels, and I'm currently on Level 3, still taking my own pace in solving the puzzles. I will post the details of the challenges in future.

Solving foobar puzzle has helped me to become a better programmer by learning up algorithms, efficient programming technique 
and most importantly understand more about the capabilities of programming language (Python).

I encourage those people who want to pick up new programming languages, the best way is to solve programming puzzle (recommeded Project Euler or HackerRank).
Solving puzzle will helps you understand deeply about programming language coding style.
